    "For our module Professional Practice in IT Skills we were tasked with forming a group and working pon a project together as a team. The group that I was part of consisted of Thomas Kenny and Arnas Stepnavicus and I. It was exciting to have the opportunity to work in a group as ideas can be passed around and you learn new styles of coding and approach to problems.\n",

    "The project which we all agreed on was a Facial Recognition application which allowed a user to Register a username and photo and allow them to Login using the same details through a Django application.\n",

    "# Research\n",
    "There are many research tools out there for programmers and are essential for projects where you might be facing any issues. I was able to express issues on Reddit and StackOverflow on problems i was facing with Flask and Django which current Developers would assist and guide me in the right direction and give me new insights to approaches I could take in solving the problems.\n",
